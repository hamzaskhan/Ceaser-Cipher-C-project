This was my first c project back in 2020. I will now actively make it better by cleaning the code, converting it into OOP, make it receive and process messages only instead of displaying it. I also plan to add more ciphers, natrally. Feel free to throw in your own contribution. I will improve the algorithm, and add in c++ instead of c. This shouldn't be a chatbot, but a backend algorithm, but as long as the original code is unchanged since I am busy with other things, you can make use of it.
